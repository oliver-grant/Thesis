\begin{center}\textbf{Abstract}\end{center}

We examine the classic binary search tree problem of Knuth \cite{knuth1971optimum}. First, we quickly re-examine a solution of G{\"u}ttler, Melhorn and Schneider \cite{guttler1980binary} which was shown to have a worst case bound of $c*H + 2$ where $c \geq 1/H(1/3,2/3) \approx 1.08$. We give a new worst case bound on the heuristic of $H+4$. In the remainder of the work, we examine the problem under various models of external memory. First, we use the Hierarchical Memory Model (HMM) of Aggarwal et al. \cite{aggarwal1987model} and propose several approximate solutions. We find that the expected cost of search is at most $\frac{W_{HMM}(P)}{\lceil lg(s_{min}) \rceil} * (H+1)$ where $W_{HMM}(P)$ is a well-defined function of the probability distribution, $s_{min} = min(min_{i \in \{1,...,n\}}(p_i), min_{j \in \{0,...,n\}}(q_j)))$, and $H$ is the entropy of the distribution. Using this, we improve a bound given in Thite's 2001 thesis for the HMM$_2$ model in the approximate setting. We also examine the problem in the Hierarchical Memory with Block Transfer Model \cite{aggarwal1987hierarchical} and find approximate solutions. Similarly, we find the expected cost is at most $\frac{W_{HMBTM}(P)}{\lceil lg(s_{min}) \rceil} * (H+1)$ where $W_{HMBTM}(P)$ is a well-defined function of the probability distribution and $s_{min}$ and $H$ are as before.
