\begin{center}\textbf{Abstract}\end{center}

We examine optimal and near optimal solutions to the classic binary search tree problem of Knuth \cite{knuth1971optimum}. First, we re-examine a solution of G{\"u}ttler, Melhorn and Schneider \cite{guttler1980binary} which was shown to have a worst case bound of $c \cdot H + 2$ where $c \geq \frac{1}{H(\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3})} \approx 1.08$. We give an improved worst case bound on the heuristic of $H+4$. Next, we examine the optimum BST problem under a model of external memory. We use the Hierarchical Memory Model (HMM) of Aggarwal et al. \cite{aggarwal1987model} and propose two approximate solutions which run in $O(n)$ time where $n$ is the number of words in our data set. Using these methods, we improve upon a bound given in Thite's 2001 thesis \cite{thite2008optimum} under the related HMM$_2$ model in the approximate setting. We also examine the related problem of binary trees on multisets of probabilities. We provide a simple $O(n \lg(n))$ algorithm that is within $\frac{n+1}{2n}$ of optimal on a multiset of $n$ keys.

\begin{center}\textbf{Acknowledgements}\end{center}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Ian Munro for guiding me during my graduate studies here at the University of Waterloo. Learning from him was a great privilege. I will fondly remember our talks about data structures, algorithms, and life in general.

I would also like to thank Mordecai Golin. Conversations with Mordecai significantly helped in the simplification of the proof in \ref{MSSolvesOpt} and helped shape Chapter \ref{An Improved Bound for the Modified Minimum Entropy Heuristic}. 

I would also like to thank my lab mate Alexandre Daigle for thoroughly proof reading my first thesis draft, and spending countless hours working on whiteboard proofs with me. Also thanks to colleagues Hisham El-Zein, Dimitrios Skrepetos and Simon Pratt for working on problems with me at various times throughout my studies.    

Finally, thanks to my committee members Anna Lubiw and Eric Blais for their constructive criticism of my work.
